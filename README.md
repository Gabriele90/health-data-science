Health Data Science (HDS) is the science and art of generating data-driven solutions through comprehension of complex real-world health problems, employing critical thinking and analytics to derive knowledge from big data. HDS is an emergent discipline, arising at the intersection of biostatistics, computer science and health. 
In those project I applied different classification and regression algorithms like as Decision Trees, SVM, logistic reghression and K-nearest neighbours, assessing their performance with several metrics.
